# springboot
Shows how we can create a service using Spring Boot and then make it register w/ service registry.

Then consume the service via Edge service with fail over mechanism in place.


**Service Discovery**

As discussed in the original post we need a standard mechanism for Service to Service calls.  A service needs to discover another service that it wants to use, also wants to make itself discoverable. We can think of several possible solutions here:
1. IP address based  - What happens that service goes down that IP becomes null and void. In cloud instantness or nodes are ephemeral so this does not work well.
2. LoadBalancer controlled Routing: 
    Data Sharding
    Data locality
    Multi tenancy 
    Controls the load balancing strategy
    RoundBobin
    Sticky Session
    LRU
3. Can we use DNS:  For open web DNS is good but not for Service to Service calls.  It canâ€™t tell you that if the service is alive. Avoid DNS for service to service calls.  
4. Service Registry: That  provides more advanced control that will know the state of the service as well.    
There are several Registry implementations available (Consul, Zookeeper, Eureka) In this example we built a Service Registry using Netflix's Eureka Service.
